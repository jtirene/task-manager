# Interview Prompt: Design a Task Scheduling and Reminder Application MVP

## Problem Statement

You are tasked with implementing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a task scheduling and reminder application. The application should help users organize their tasks, set reminders, and receive notifications. Consider the following requirements along with bonus challenges:

## Requirements

1. Task Management:
   Implement a system for users to create, edit, and delete tasks. Each task should have a title, description, due date, and priority level.

1. Reminder System:
   Integrate a reminder system that sends notifications to users for upcoming tasks based on their specified due dates and times.
   Allow users to choose how they want to be notified (e.g., push notifications, email, or both).

1. User Preferences:
   Enable users to set preferences for default notification settings, such as the default time for reminders and the notification sound.

1. Task Categorization:
   Implement a feature to categorize tasks into different categories or labels (e.g., work, personal, health).
   Allow users to filter tasks based on categories.

## Bonus Challenges

1. Recurring Tasks:
   Extend the application to support recurring tasks, allowing users to set tasks that repeat daily, weekly, or monthly.

1. Location-Based Reminders:
   Introduce location-based reminders, where users receive notifications when they arrive or leave a specific location.

1. Collaborative Task Lists:
   Implement the ability for users to create collaborative task lists that can be shared with and edited by multiple users.

1. Integration with External Calendars:
   Explore integration with external calendar services (e.g., Google Calendar) to synchronize tasks and reminders.

## Note

Your implementation should cover both the initial requirements and the bonus challenges. Choose a programming language of your preference and showcase your ability to create a task scheduling and reminder application with enhanced features. Ensure that your code is well-organized, handles edge cases, and provides a user-friendly experience.
